# Ludics

A lightweight personal AI infrastructure — a harness for humans working with AI agents. Ludics manages a small number of concurrent "slots," aggregates tasks from GitHub and READMEs, allows merging of overlapping tasks, provides flow-based task views, and wires triggers for briefings and syncs.

Inspired by Daniel Miessler's Personal AI Infrastructure, by Steve Yegge's Gas Town, and Emacs' org-mode. Formerly `pai-lite`.

## What you get

- **Slots**: 6 ephemeral "CPUs" for active work, not memory or identity.
- **Task index**: unified task list from GitHub issues and README TODOs.
- **Flow engine**: priority/dependency-based views (ready, blocked, critical, impact).
- **Adapters**: thin integrations with existing agent setups (agent-duo, Claude Code, claude.ai, manual).
- **Notifications**: ntfy.sh integration — outgoing (strategic), incoming (from phone), agents (operational).
- **Triggers**: launchd/systemd automation for briefings and syncs.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Install Bun (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# 2. Clone and build
gh repo clone lukstafi/ludics
cd ludics
bun install
bun run build    # compiles bin/ludics

# 3. Add to PATH (if not already)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"
```

### Dependencies

**Required: [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (v1.1+)**

```bash
# Install Bun (macOS, Linux, WSL)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Then build the ludics binary:

```bash
cd ludics
bun install
bun run build
```

**Other dependencies:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install jq tmux

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install jq tmux
```

- `bun` — TypeScript runtime and build tool (required)
- `gh` — GitHub CLI (for cloning state repo and fetching issues)
- `jq` — JSON filtering (used by some adapters and triggers)
- `tmux` — terminal multiplexer (Mag runs in a tmux session)
- `ttyd` — optional, for web access to Mag's terminal

## Quickstart Tutorial

This tutorial walks through setting up ludics and using it to manage your work.

### Step 1: Configure your state repository

ludics stores state (slots, tasks) in a separate private repository. Edit the pointer config:

```bash
${EDITOR:-vi} ~/.config/ludics/config.yaml
```

Set your state repo:

```yaml
state_repo: your-username/your-private-repo
state_path: harness
```

### Step 2: Configure your projects

The full configuration lives in your state repo at `harness/config.yaml`. Create it manually (or use `ludics init` once it's migrated):

```bash
${EDITOR:-vi} ~/your-private-repo/harness/config.yaml
```

Add the projects you want to track:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: my-project
    repo: your-username/my-project
    issues: true          # Fetch GitHub issues

  - name: another-project
    repo: your-username/another-project
    issues: true

triggers:
  watch:
    - paths:
        - ~/repos/my-project/README.md   # Scan for checkboxes/TODOs
      action: tasks sync
```

### Step 3: Sync tasks from your projects

```bash
ludics tasks sync
```

This aggregates tasks from GitHub issues and README TODOs into `tasks.yaml`, automatically converts them to individual `.md` task files in `harness/tasks/`, and refreshes metadata for existing GitHub-backed tasks (including closed state). The flow engine reads these task files.

### Step 4: Verify triggers

Triggers automate Mag startup and periodic task sync via launchd (macOS) or systemd (Linux). If Mag is enabled in your config, a keepalive trigger also starts Mag at login and checks every 15 minutes. Install them with:

Verify with:

```bash
ludics triggers status
```

To reinstall or update triggers separately:

```bash
ludics triggers install
```

To pause ongoing scheduled activity without deleting trigger files:

```bash
ludics stop
```

To fully remove all installed trigger units/plists:

```bash
ludics stop uninstall
```

### Step 5: Get an overview

```bash
# Quick status
ludics status

# Full briefing
ludics briefing
```

## Configuration

ludics uses a two-tier config:

1. **Pointer config** (`~/.config/ludics/config.yaml`): minimal, just points to state repo:
   ```yaml
   state_repo: your-username/your-private-repo
   state_path: harness   # optional, defaults to "harness"
   ```
2. **Full config** (`~/state-repo/harness/config.yaml`): projects, adapters, triggers, notifications — once this exists, the pointer config is only used to locate it.

For the full list of options and their defaults, see [`templates/config.reference.yaml`](templates/config.reference.yaml).

### Example full config

```yaml
state_repo: your-username/private-state
state_path: harness

projects:
  - name: my-app
    repo: your-username/my-app
    issues: true

mag:
  enabled: true

adapters:
  agent-duo:
    enabled: true
  claude-code:
    enabled: true
  manual:
    enabled: true

triggers:
  startup:
    enabled: true
    action: mag briefing
  sync:
    enabled: true
    interval: 3600
    action: tasks sync
  watch:
    - paths:
        - ~/repos/my-app/README.md
      action: tasks sync

notifications:
  provider: ntfy
  topics:
    outgoing: your-username-from-Mag  # Mag → user (strategic, push to phone)
    incoming: your-username-to-Mag    # user → Mag (messages from phone)
    agents: your-username-agents      # system → user (operational)
```

## CLI Reference

### Task management

```bash
ludics tasks sync              # Aggregate tasks, convert files, refresh existing GitHub task metadata
ludics tasks list              # Show unified task list
ludics tasks show <id>         # Show task details
ludics tasks convert           # Convert tasks.yaml to task files (also run by sync)
ludics tasks update            # Refresh GitHub metadata for existing tasks (preserves local title edits)
ludics tasks create <title>    # Create a new task manually
ludics tasks files             # List individual task files
```

### Flow engine

```bash
ludics flow ready              # Priority-sorted ready tasks
ludics flow blocked            # What's blocked and why
ludics flow critical           # Deadlines + high-priority
ludics flow impact <id>        # What this task unblocks
ludics flow context            # Context distribution across slots
ludics flow check-cycle        # Check for dependency cycles
```

### Slot management

```bash
ludics slots                   # Show all slots
ludics slot <n>                # Show slot n details
ludics slot <n> assign <task>  # Assign a task to slot n
ludics slot <n> clear          # Clear slot n
ludics slot <n> start          # Start agent session (adapter)
ludics slot <n> stop           # Stop agent session (adapter)
ludics slot <n> note "text"    # Add runtime note to slot n
```

### Notifications

```bash
ludics notify outgoing <msg>   # Send strategic notification (alias: pai)
ludics notify agents <msg>     # Send operational notification
ludics notify subscribe        # Subscribe to incoming messages (long-running)
ludics notify recent [n]       # Show recent notifications
```

### Mag (autonomous coordinator)

```bash
ludics mag briefing          # Request morning briefing
ludics mag suggest           # Get task suggestions
ludics mag analyze <issue>   # Analyze GitHub issue
ludics mag elaborate <id>    # Elaborate task into detailed spec
ludics mag health-check      # Check for deadlines, issues
ludics mag queue             # Show pending requests
```

### Using skills directly

You don't need Mag to use ludics skills. Clone your harness repository and run Claude Code in the harness directory — skills like `ludics-briefing`, `ludics-elaborate`, and others work directly. This is useful for read-only tasks (checking status, getting briefings) or when you need something done immediately without waiting for Mag queue.

### Overview and setup

```bash
ludics status                  # Overview of slots + tasks
ludics briefing                # Morning briefing
ludics init                    # Full install/update: binary, skills, hooks, triggers
ludics stop                    # Pause scheduled trigger activity
ludics stop uninstall          # Uninstall trigger units/plists
ludics triggers install        # Reinstall launchd/systemd triggers only
ludics doctor                  # Check environment and dependencies
ludics help                    # Show help
```

## Adapters

Adapters are thin integrations that translate external state into slot format:

| Adapter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `agent-duo` | Reads `.peer-sync/` state from agent-duo sessions |
| `agent-solo` | Single-agent mode for agent-duo |
| `claude-code` | Inspects tmux sessions running Claude Code |
| `claude-ai` | Treats bookmarked claude.ai URLs as sessions |
| `chatgpt-com` | Tracks ChatGPT browser sessions |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI integration |
| `manual` | Track human work without an agent |

## Triggers

Triggers automate periodic actions:

- **macOS**: launchd agents for `startup`, `sync`, and Mag keepalive
- **Linux (Ubuntu)**: systemd user units and timers

If `mag.enabled` is `true` in your config, `triggers install` also creates a Mag keepalive service that starts Mag at login and checks every 15 minutes.

Configure in `config.yaml` under `triggers:` and `mag:`. Then run:

```bash
ludics triggers install
```

Stop all scheduled trigger activity:

```bash
ludics stop
```

## Multi-machine setup

ludics supports running across multiple machines. All state lives in a git repository, so any machine with access can read slots, tasks, and flow views. For coordinating Mag (so only one instance runs at a time), ludics provides federation with Tailscale networking.

### How it works

- **Git-backed state**: every machine clones the same harness repo. Pull to see the latest state, push to share yours.
- **Tailscale networking**: optional MagicDNS-based hostname resolution for cross-machine URLs. Configure `network.mode: tailscale` in your harness config.
- **Seniority-based leader election**: nodes are listed in your config in priority order. The highest-priority node with a fresh heartbeat (< 15 min) becomes Mag leader. If the leader goes offline, the next node takes over automatically.
- **Heartbeats**: each node publishes a heartbeat every 5 minutes to `federation/heartbeats/`. The federation trigger handles this.

### Typical deployment

An always-on machine (e.g., Mac Mini) runs Mag 24/7 via launchd, while your laptop pulls state via git and runs worker slots. Any machine can also run ludics skills directly by opening Claude Code in the harness directory.

### Federation commands

```bash
ludics network status              # Show network configuration
ludics federation status           # Show leader, nodes, heartbeats
ludics federation tick             # Publish heartbeat + run election
ludics federation elect            # Run leader election only
ludics federation heartbeat        # Publish heartbeat only
```

Enable federation in your harness `config.yaml`:

```yaml
network:
  mode: tailscale
  nodes:
    - name: mac-mini
      tailscale_hostname: mac-mini.tailnet-name.ts.net
    - name: macbook
      tailscale_hostname: macbook.tailnet-name.ts.net

triggers:
  federation:
    enabled: true
    interval: 300
    action: federation tick
```

## Architecture

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design, including:

- Slot model and lifecycle
- Flow engine design
- Mag (autonomous Claude Opus coordinator)
- Queue-based communication
- Notification tiers
- Multi-machine federation and deployment

## Development

```bash
bun install            # Install dependencies
bun run typecheck      # Type-check (tsc --noEmit)
bun run build          # Compile to bin/ludics
bun run dev            # Run directly from source (no compile)
```

- Core logic is TypeScript in `src/`. Adapters remain in Bash (`adapters/`).
- State changes to slots auto-commit to the state repo.
